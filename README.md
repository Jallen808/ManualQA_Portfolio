## About Me
My name is Joseph Allen. I'm a detail-oriented, hard working person who's always looking to self-improve and develop my skills. I'm a self-starter who can also thrive in a team environment where clear communication is key.

I graduated high school and attended community college in Illinois. I've resided in Hawaii for several years now where I've completed the Careerist Academy bootcamp. I've furthered my education by self-learning through Udemy courses, Youtube tutorials and ample note-taking.

For half a year, after completing the Careerist Academy bootcamp, I interned with LingoCard. LingoCard is a language-learning app for both mobile devices and web browsers. I applied what I've learned in my education to help deliver a quality product.
